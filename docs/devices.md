# Devices Controlled by Home Assistant
The following devices are controlled via my Home Assistant configurations. They may also provide sensors as input.
## Climate Control
| Device | Functionality |
| ---| --- |
| [Nest Thermostat (3rd generation)](http://amzn.to/2umTkEp) | Component: [Nest](https://home-assistant.io/components/nest/)<br>Temperature sensors and heating status information along with target temperature being able to be controlled via Home Assistant<br><br>Limitations:<ul><li>Requires setup of a Nest Developer account (free)</li><li>Whilst 3rd gen Nest Thermostat in the UK provides the ability to control the hot water system. This isn't exposed via current implementation in Home Assistant.</li></ul> |
| [Nest Cam IQ Indoor](https://nest.com/uk/cameras/nest-cam-iq-indoor/overview/) | Component: [Nest](https://home-assistant.io/components/nest/)<br>Camera with motion detection, person detection and sound detection.<br><br>Limitations:<ul><li>Requires setup of a Nest Developer account (free) (this is a single Nest account regardless of the number of Nest devices)</li></ul> |

## Power and Lighting control
| Device |  Functionality |
| ---| --- |
| [Lightwave RF Devices](https://www.lightwaverf.com) <ul><li>Plug in sockets ([JSJSLW321](http://amzn.to/2vN1oys))</li><li>Inline Dimmer module ([JSJSLW831](http://amzn.to/2vLdcjH))</li><li>Smartphone Web Link - Hub ([JSJSLW930](http://amzn.to/2vLbJKq)) (Note: Not needed for Home Assistant Control)</li></ul> | Component: [RFXtrx](https://home-assistant.io/components/rfxtrx/)<br>LightwaveRF devices provide an easy solution for retrofitting automation into existing homes. Many other technologies require both Live and Neutral to be present at light switches, which is uncommon for UK installations at least<br><br>Limitations:<ul><li>One-Way communication, you can not query state to know devices status, nor can you confirm if commands sent were obeyed.</li></ul> |
| [TP-Link HS110 WiFi Smart Plug with energy monitoring](http://amzn.to/2vgQU8Q) | Component: [switch.tplink](https://home-assistant.io/components/switch.tplink/)<br>WiFi controlled plugin adapter with Energy monitoring. Enabling actions/automation to be triggered based on power usage. Similar to Belkin Wemo<br><br>Limitations:<ul><li>Nothing significant so far. I now have 3 of these deivices to replace Wemo Insight Plugs. Hoping they last longer.</li></ul> |
| [Sonoff WiFi Relay Modules](http://sonoff.itead.cc/en/) (with modified hardware and firmware) <ul><li>Inline 10A Relay ([Sonoff Switch](http://amzn.to/2xmjjIY))</li><li>Inline 16A Relay with temperature and humidity monitoring ([Sonoff TH16](http://amzn.to/2wiJKm0))</li></ul> | Component: [MQTT Switch](https://home-assistant.io/components/switch.mqtt/)<br>Simple MQTT enabled wifi relay/switches and sensors at an incredibly low cost. With modifications: <ul><li>Hardware modified by solding headers onto Sonoff board to enable custome firmware updating.</li><li>Custom Firmware to provide simple web configuration and control and MQTT support. Currently using [Sonoff-Tasmota](https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota) additional information  in the [project wiki](https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/wiki)</li></ul>Limitations:<ul><li>Need to open up devices and solder headers to flash custom firmware.</li><li>Need to flash custom firmware via [3.3V FTDI USB-to-Serial Converter/Programmer](http://amzn.to/2xlYJIw) (Be sure to set USB to serial programmer to **3.3V**, it may be 5V by default (mine was) and will likely kill the ESP8266 is you supply it with 5V.)</li><li>Need to setup MQTT Broker on Raspberry Pi. I'm using Mosquitto. [Useful setup video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsDHEDbyLfg)</li><li>The TH16 Device is CE marked and having compared the design to the original switch, with a fuse and greater separation between High and Low voltage components.</li><li>The Sonoff Basic switch is not CE certified, based onthe [CE Certification](https://www.itead.cc/wiki/File:CE_Certificate_for_Sonoff_Series.pdf) document. Caution should be used with this device.</li></ul> |
| [Flamerite Electric Fire](http://www.flameritefires.com/products/floor-standing-suites/junai.html) | Component: [switch.rfxtrx](https://home-assistant.io/components/switch.rfxtrx/)<br>Our famerite fire came with a 433Mhz remote control. The RFXCOM 433 Transceiver was able to detect the codes from the remote and allow Home Assistant to send the same codes |
| [Belkin Wemo Insight Switch, WiFi SmartPlug](http://amzn.to/2vMEtmN) | Component: [Wemo](https://home-assistant.io/components/wemo/)<br>WiFi controlled plugin adapter with Energy monitoring. Enabling actions/automation to be triggered based on power usage<br><br>Limitations:<ul><li>Questionable reliability: I've had two now fail with similar symptoms when turning off devices which pull a considerable current, ~18kW. This is significantly less than the 13A/240V rated maximum. I've now removed all Wemo Insight Plugs from my home. It's possible the current load readings from the Wemo were wrong, investigating.</li><li>Setup problems: Early firmware versions had problems with setup, especially in environments with multiple access points.</li><li>No memory of last power state. In the event of a recovery from a power cut, the device connected will remain off.</li></ul> |
