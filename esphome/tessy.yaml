# The following shows how to change the name of a sensor and how to change any of the parameters.
# tesla_ble_vehicle: # THIS LINE MUST BE UNCOMMENTED IF ANY OF THE CHANGES BELOW ARE WANTED

# You can change any sensor name in Home Assistant. However you can also change them here if it is more convenient for you.
# For a list of all sensors etc, see the file client.yml in the packages directory.
#  odometer: # miles by default, edit the entity in home assistant if you need km
#    name: "Odometro" # Rename if desired
# End of renaming

# At the time of writing, these are set to the default values. If you require a different value, uncomment and edit the value
#  update_interval: 10s # Base polling interval, used for VCSEC sensors

#  poll_charging_period: 10 # Period to poll for data when charging (s)
#  poll_asleep_period: 60 # Period to poll for data when asleep (s)
#  ble_disconnected_min_time: 300 # Minimum time BLE must be disconnected before sensors are Unknown (s)
#  fast_poll_if_unlocked: 1 # if != 0, fast polls are enabled when unlocked

# Enable Home Assistant API
